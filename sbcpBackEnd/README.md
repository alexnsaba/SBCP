We use Keras, an easy-to-use deep learning framework which builds on top of tensorflow to build and train the model.

# How to use

We got an accuracy of 86% after finishing the training process. If you need a higer accuracy, you could adjust the network achitectures and training parameters. Required dependencies: *tensorflow*, *keras*, *numpy* and *python*. 

After finishing the training process, put the model (*****_sbcp.h5_*****) in *****_static_***** folder of Flask app and run the following commands to start the app:Ã¥

    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    python -m flask run
